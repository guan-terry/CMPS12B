The role of this assignment was to help us get more practice programming in C 
as well as teach us dynamic memory allocation using calloc, malloc, and free.

You can use charType.c by using the make command followed by ./charType <input>
<output>

charType.c -
	It tells you the character type of each line and prints it to the output file
	
Makefile -
	make: creates charType.exe and charType.o
	make clean: removes charType.exe and charType.of

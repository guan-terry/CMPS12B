The role of this project was to see if you could print N-Queens on an NxN board
if you're able to print N-Queens on an NxN board than you would print out every
queen, if you're not able to print N-Queens, then you would print out "No solution"

Makefile - 
	make - makes the jar file for NQueens file
	make clean - cleans out NQueens.jar and NQueens.class
	
NQueens.jar - java -jar NQueens.jar "input-file" "output-file"
	Runs the program and prints the outputs to the "output-file"
	
test-input.txt - 
	The input file used for N-Queens
	
test-output.txt - 
	The output files used for N-Queens
	
NQueens.java - 
	The raw file for NQueens
	
README -

The role of Lab2 was to practice using command line arguments, having inputs and outputs on files, 
as well as String manipulation.

You can use FileReverse by using make on the command line.

FileReverse.java - takes 2 command line arguments and it will read each line of the input file and
prints out each token backwards to the output file.
Makefile - compiles FileReverse and creates a jar file in which it can run.

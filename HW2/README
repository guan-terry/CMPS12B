The role of this project is to store a chessboard as a linked list of chesspieces 
and verify that two pieces do not occupy the same square in the chessboard, given 
a square, determine if any pieces occupy that specific square, determine if the 
piece on that specifc square can attack any other pieces in the opposite color.

Makefile - 
	make - ChessBoard, bishop, king, Pawn, knight, queen, rook, and ChessPiece into 
	ChessBoard.jar
	make clean - cleans out ChessBoard, Pawn, bishop, King, Knight, Queen, Rook, 
	ChessPiece.
	
Pawn-
	The pawn for the ChessBoard
Bishop -
	The bishop for the ChessBoard
	
Rook -
	The rook for the ChessBoard
	
Queen -
	The queen for the ChessBoard
	
ChessPiece-
	An abstract java class for the ChessBoard
	
Knight - 
	The knight for the ChessBoard
	
King -
	The king class for the ChessBoard
	
ChessBoard.jar - java -jar ChessBoard.jar "input-file" "output-file"
	Runs the program and prints the outputs to the "output-file"
	
test-input.txt - 
	The input file used for ChessBoard
	
test-output.txt - 
	The output files used for ChessBoard, prints out the specific chesspiece on 
	the given square if any, if that chesspiece attacks any other chesspieces, 
	invalid if two chesspiece occupies the same square, and - if the given square 
	is empty.
